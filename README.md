    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Using real-world map data from Busungbiu District in Buleleng Regency, Bali Province. The data was converted into a graph using distance data and fictitious road conditions due to the difficulty of finding accurate information. The Backtracking algorithm was used to find the best route based on distance and road conditions.</p>

    <h2>Research Process</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            1. Searching for data on the distribution of villages in Busungbiu Subdistrict
            <br> 2. Converting real-world map data into graph form using fictional distance and road condition data
            <br> 3. Converting graph data into Python code
            <br> 4. Building code with a backtracking algorithm with the following flow:
            <br> - The user provides input in the form of the starting village and destination village
            <br> - The program creates all possible routes in tree form
            <br> - The program searches for the best route and route recommendations based on the given conditions
            <br> - The program provides output in the form of route search results
        </p>
